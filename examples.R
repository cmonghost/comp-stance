# [1] [professor] says THAT apparently if you go onto it you can like open the homework again
# [2] A: Yeah, so final means THAT a segment.. a whole segment has ended. Not just that sentence or that utterance or whatever. So they're talking about segments. Which can be made up of several utterances. Maybe. \nK: Uh-huh.\nA: OK I don’t know.
# [3] Aren't you worried ZERO there's a bear gonna come in?
# [4] But i guess early on their kids already know THAT their mom is into this
# [5] But is there a proposition.. so involved in all cases? So I have not read a single thing on directives and updating the to-do-list but is it OK to say THAT there is a proposition? So I request THAT "you - proposition"?
# [6] cos like our study sort of finds THAT like credibility is context-- credibility in language style is context dependent, right.
# [7] I mean I'm just wondering cause it seems LIKE the parents always spend a lot of time together.
# [8] I think that means THAT there's no jury. [int: "yeah it says the defendant opted to have no jury."] You're allowed to do that!? That's fucked.
# [9] If it's 11:59 it says THAT it's late?
# [10] It seems LIKE she was very well liked by- by everybody.
# [11] L: Not having second thoughts? N: Uh-uh. (jokingly) Unless you are. (laughs) Which I doubt. L: (laughs) You better think a-fuckin-gain. N: (laughs) L: You're right to doubt it. N: (laughs) No, just kidding. L: Did you ever like- I don't know. Am I always like transparent to you? N: Yeah. L: You always know THAT I want it? N: Yeah. L: You never- I never- you're never like, "What's she feeling? What's she thinking?" N: No. I know you! L: (laughs) Ah- sometimes I wish I could be mysterious to you, you know? N: I can read you like a book. (laughs) L: (laughs) Oh my God, please!
# [12] L: Oh, [name]! That's his day. That's his family day. N: Mm-hm. L: So cute. Love it. N: Yeah, I'm sure he like only works here weekends or something. L: Yeah, you mentioned 0 he doesn't live here? N: He lives far.
# [13] L: Okay, so there you go, there's your pictures. I mean it's different in different lighting too, so like- D: Yeah, the iPhone is- N: Yours has like- L: Nice like- D: Crisper image right? L: Hm? D: Can you see? N: Fancier options. L: Mine has like- yeah, mine like you can go into the camera and like customise all these options but for like the layman, I don't know what I'm doing with it so like it's kind of useleless. The iPhone has a better like dummy-proof- like just takes good pictures by default. Mine's probably like customisable but I don't know how to use it so it's basically whatever. D: Actually yours is pretty good though Lisa. L: I mean it's fine. N: It's Leica. L: It's a Leica lens, but- whatever that means, like whatever that's good for, you know? N: It's like an actual camera, you know. L: Yeah, but like in practic-- like look at the pictures on the fridge. If you zoom in on them, they're really not that like clear. You see 0 it's kind of like grainy almost? D: Well they're not bad. N: So is this. L: Well, that's true. I don't know. I don't know. R: Close enough. L: My- I think that iPhones also like- I don't know if they like colour grade...
# [14] Like didn't he say 0 he thought he had [redacted].
# [15] So do you think it's more likely that um- we know THAT these two are distinct and these two are distinct because they occur in the same place right?
# [16] So it's possible THAT it takes some time for me to get back to you.
# [17] So when you're saying 0 it's like a natural change to go from this to this, what do you mean by that?
# [18] So where's the actual opinion, why does he say THAT he's- he wasn't uh... (trails off)
# [19] Some people say 0 it's only with the person you cheers with.
# [20] Some right-wingers in the US got mad at him because they found out THAT um, PSY had like made a song a few years before Gangnam Style got popular about like killing United States troops or whatever.
# [21] Where did we say THAT this occurs before?
# [22] yeah so it seems LIKE there's a pretty . there's like a few volumes.
# [23] You said 0 you worked?

# [1] ... and we would agree THAT it would have to be at least an hour to an hour and a half
# [2] ... the invictus games. [int: "what's that?"] mum said 0 it's like- for like "wounded warriors" or something
# [3] A: It's good THAT you could make it short
# [4] A: So syntactically a question should be either a yes/no question or a wh-question, but pragmatically, if something is pragmatically a question, it can be syntactically a declarative, as you said. \nInt: Yeah, yeah. But I don’t have any examples of that in my head. \nA: Hm. Let’s say 0 you tell me a story, and.. I find out the last part: “..and finally he didn’t go”. “Yes”, you would say. I just said a declarative, with a fall and I expected THAT that would be the ending, so you say “yes”. This is what I can think of. \nInt: OK, yeah.
# [5] A: Yeah. And it gave .. gave us false alarms, twice, already.\nInt: .. false alarms too, no?\nA: Because Mark was moving around and maybe he went to a marginal position, I don’t know, maybe that’s why it’s started [..] it was [...]. Oh! And the second is THAT we keep forgetting to turn it off when we take Mark, so it always like “toot toot toot”. It doesn’t sound right away, so it waits for I don’t know ten seconds or so? And especially in the evening when I wake up to breastfeed him. I wake up, with my one eye open - I always open just one eye because this other one doesn’t want to open when I try. And then I, sleeping, sitting asleep, breastfeeding him, and suddenly this “toottoottoottoottoottoottoot”. I have to stand up, you know, get him off my breast, I hate it. I should not forget it.
# [6] And it turns out ZERO the person that they were going to hire was the husband of an existing professor
# [7] and the funny thing is ZERO he never smiles, I've never seen him smile
# [8] And then, we started doing research, and it turns out THAT a lot of universities- it's more prevalent in- yeah. in the states though, it's more prevalent to do- to have spousal hiring
# [9] And there is one of these morphemes that has two allomorphs, meaning 0 it can appear in two different forms depending on where ah it appears
# [10] but imagine ZERO you get on a case that's like y-- like . what's that one case that's ongoing right now in Nova Scotia?
# [11] but the interesting thing was THAT uhm we took our kayaks so we got to go kayaking out on- along the shore which was really something
# [12] but what if you know ZERO your-- what if you know ZERO they're guilty?
# [13] Did you hear THAT last night, there was this big art exhibit downtown?
# [14] Do you notice THAT in the IPA in the book
# [15] However, if you find THAT the environment directly before and the environment directly after are still the same and this sound makes a difference, then you can be fairly sure that they're phonemes.
# [16] I guess it's not so bad THAT we lost most of the other recording, because it was mostly just like us like chewing and chomping and stuff.
# [17] I MEAN I think ZERO it's . it's good that now we're actually going to have these discussions 'cos we can't pretend LIKE it's something of the past or something that's not like present in our field
# [18] I mean it makes sense THAT you could I just
# [19] I mean that's the plan, THAT the class writes a paper.
# [20] if you would've kind of known THAT you were going to end up with a more creative career path, what would you have . what would you have done differently while you were in your graduate program?
# [21] In the states they'll open up these 'magnet schools' in like low-income neighbourhoods and they'll say like if you live here you can go here.
# [22] Int: Is Bence in there, too? Does he wake up to all this?\nA: Oh no. He doe.. most of the times he stays asleep. \nInt: Oh. I ... \nA: The next day he says 0 “Oh I’ve woken up like three times”
# [23] Int: Yeah, so the listener should interpret the speaker’s utterance by taking into account subsequent utterances... which is a bit weird. If the speaker’s asking a question, how can the listener interpret the question based on what comes after the question?\nA: Well, if the tone of the question, if there really is a rising boundary tone, then the hearer will know that “Oh, this is a question. I should contribute.” Maybe.\nInt: Yeah.
# [24] It's nice that it's actually fall up here
# [25] It's nice that it's actually fall up here and there's leaves on the ground
# [26] it's true THAT I was actually thinking of really focusing on these contexts where there was creak
# [27] Just make sure 0 you give me enough time to help you.
# [28] K: So rising intonation for non-genuine questions can indicate speaker’s doubt about an answer to the question. They have an example here. \nA: Yeah. \nK: A rising intonation is like the speaker doubts THAT the answer that the hearer is giving them is not the right answer.\nA: Yeah. So, for example you say THAT.. um.. you say THAT “I won the lottery” and “You won the lottery?” \nK: Yeah. \nA: So.. there is an answer that’s salient, but I don’t believe it.\nK: Yeah, yeah. Um.. OK, conclusion!
# [29] L: (jokingly) You know 0 if you- actually [mother's boyfriend] can't have any, 'cause if you eat cherries and beer you- it makes you die. D: Oh, Opa used to say, yeah. L: Yeah. D: Can't have the two together.
# [30] L: Celebrity crushes? D: Oh, George Clooney. L: You've always loved George Clooney. You've literally George- loved George Clooney for so many years, it's like you've loved George Clooney longer than you've loved me. N: (laughs) L: It's crazy. D: That's why I went out with [mother's boyfriend], 'cause I thought he looked like him. (all laugh) L: (to mother's boyfriend) I think [my friend], when she met you, she said- she was like- she said afterward that you looked like George Clooney or something. (all laugh) D: See? See? L: 'Cause she said 0 you had the like salt and pepper hair thing. D: Ah, see? Ah? George Clooney's got the salt and pepper. L: Yeah, and she- and she said it looked good on you.

# [33] L: I think that Androids, like they actually- like when you buy- like when you set one up nowadays, I think it might have like- that's like a thing it asks you for anyway, 'cause they know 0 people might be coming from iPhone.
# [34] L: I've been uh- ever since the news, that's all I've been thinking about. D: Ever since what? L: Ever since we heard 0 it was coming out again (laughs)- another one was coming out.
# [35] let me make sure 0 this is still recording
# [36] Let's pretend THAT it's there for now, sa-tis-fy
# [37] Let's say 0 we have the words [unintelligible] and [unintelligible].
# [38] Meaning 0 it's still [redacted]?
# [39] Please make sure 0 you turn in your homework [...].
# [40] Please make sure you turn in your homework and THAT you fill in a consent form.
# [41] Please turn in homework 1 and make sure 0 you sign a consent form.
# [42] Pretend THAT they're giving a genuine interview
# [43] She gets the sense THAT I know what I'm doing
# [44] So he's saying THAT they have to balance individuality with "the necessity of the desire", so they don't only need to do it but they need to want to do it
# [45] So let's say 0 you can't find an- uh- two words that are completely identical.
# [46] So let's say- let's say 0 we have [penu] here but um it would be [ephnu] elsewhere.
# [47] So they haven't told you THAT you have to wear the um- what's it called, the swim cap?
# [48] So when we add "no", then um I put in my addressee's mouth the speech act to restrict, so we restrict, and then, the request to provide the.. a possible answer, but since the restriction already results in uh.. possible worlds none of which gives the correct answer, because we're talking about a rhetorical question, it's fine to have the same.. to ask.. to put the request in the addressee's mouth. Because then the addressee will request the same from me but it's OK because we all know THAT there is a... well, OK, this is not a nice explanation but..
# [49] So you said 0 you have family here though?
# [50] That means ZERO we're gonna have a great time on September 28th.
# [51] There is no indication THAT she wasn't gonna be advising anymore.
# [52] They're going to notice NA parang, "oh they reply right away."
# [53] well and then another one is ZERO they both talk about um their previous convictions
# [54] Well he's he's fortunate THAT his ex wife has kicked right in and has been doing all this stuff for him
# [55] what if you know ZERO they're guilty?
# [56] yeah [NAME] was telling me ZERO people can take forever to do their generals papers
# [57] yeah I guess it'll be nice THAT we'll be equally busy
# [58] Yeah, actually, let's say 0 it's a research group meeting and we're.. you know.. brainstorming and someone finally comes up with a crucial question, like "Oh, but does Arabic have gender? Like grammatical gender? Right?" So comes up with the right question like "Isn't that the right question?" So maybe this context would save it. So because the.. Spanish speakers probably said intuitively 0 "oh no, that's not OK", but you know, with the context, it could be
# [59] Yeah, actually, let's say 0 it's a research group meeting and we're.. you know.. brainstorming and someone finally comes up with a crucial question, like "Oh, but does Arabic have gender?

# [60] Yeah. Makes sense. It's kinda weird THAT people still have incest, though.
# [61] you know we decided ZERO we were just going to make the most of it
# [62] You'll see THAT even though there's two there two symbols per height, it's not necessarily in the same level

# [1] ... and notice THAT the lavaliere mike is very close to me
# [2] "The court observes, based on his nearly 30 years on the bench, that an URBAN"- "URBAN"- "heroin dealer not in possession of a firearm would be an anomaly." So they're saying THAT like, "Well, ALL 'black drug dealers' carry guns, so of course he should be afraid of his life- afraid for his life." Like what the FUCK.
# [3] "we wished ZERO we would've stayed in school longer"
# [4] (drawing on board) So. The rule that applies here was THAT mid vowels are pronounced as high vowels at the end of the word. So this /o/ is a mid vowel here.
# [5] (very long turn summarizing methodology of labov department store study) So he did that. And you-know, he found THAT you-know, there was less- they pronounced- more people said 'four' than 'fo' when they were in a higher class store
# [6] [int: "Well hemophilia is also an autosomal recessive disease, so I wonder if there IS some kind of heterozygous advantage. Although wasn't it- wasn't it-"] You know what the advantage is, the advantage is ZERO you get to be king if you have it.

# [9] [professor] tells you THAT if you see this (writes on board) like these two segments together or these two together, you're suppposed to take it as a- a long consonant. So you can write- you can write these two. Because basically what this means- by putting these two, he means that it's just a long one of these. He just doubles it to show you that it's long. You can also note that by um putting like these little- it's a basically a colon after it. If you put a colon after a segment it means that it's longer...

# [16] A police department in the States was refusing applicants whose IQ- who had an IQ test above a certain amount. [int: "Really?!"] Yeah. [int: "Why?"] Because- they- because they were- they found THAT police with a higher IQ uh you-know like, thought critically about what they were doing and resigned and they- there was a high turnover rate of people with high IQ- with high results on the IQ test.
# [17] A: 57% of genuine questions has a rise? And then, only 12 percent of them has a fall. But what about the rest? \nInt: I.. I just..\nA: No no no I interpreted it wrong!\nInt: 237 questions, only 57% are genuine. \nA: Uh huh. Yeah. I’m sorry. I interpreted it wrong. But it still shows THAT.. what they.. said, and what Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg also said.. THAT when there’s a rise, it can be correlated with, well likely correlated with subsequent utterances, and questionhood, like genuine questions, right?\nInt: Uh-huh\nA: So the end of the story is THAT yes, falls are correlated somehow with you knowing the answer. \nInt: Yeah.
# [18] A: And the same thing with um.. like medicine, or.. you know \nInt: Healthcare?\nA: Yeah. Healthcare. There are a lot of ancient practices that have no point any more. And still, people.. így ragaszkodnak hozzá. Like people.. insist.\nUh so when it’s called evidence-based medicine, or evidence-based, oh whatever, I forgot the term. But it means THAT if something’s proven to not help, then we shouldn’t do it any more. And.. you know.
# [19] A: He was so interested in intonational phonology THAT he had to come
# [20] A: There is this debate that.. I don’t know how much you know about the Hungarian school system but we need.. we needed to learn a lot of like.. lexical knowledge, like memorizing wikipedia.. what for? And there is this debate that should people learn the.. the national anthem. I mean, the first verse, of course, but it has ten verses. And you know, children.. everybody is obliged to learn it by heart. I had to learn it by heart. Of course I don’t know it any more by heart. But why would they learn it? I mean, it doesn’t.. it has some cognitive benefits if you learn something, like um.. me.. memorize things, but.. at a certain point, it doesn’t go.. you know, you don’t have more.. it’s not proportional any more. So.. it doesn’t mean THAT the more you learn, the more you memorize, the more.. I don’t know. The better your brain will function as an adult. I mean.. I mean, that’s what the new minister of education said, who is also a researcher on reading, so olvasáskutató [the Hungarian word for expert on reading] in Hungary. I hope she will get the power necessary to put through her new ideas about public education because. \n
# [21] A: Yeah, it must be the teeth. \nInt: Already?\nInt2: Yup.\nA: Yeah. \nInt2: Kis muki (Hungarian)\nA: I mean it’s not that they are coming, and it’s not even swollen, it’s.. something must be happening there because he clearly, he grabs things and chews them, not just sucking or anything but chewing and his salliva is coming all the time and everybody who sees him says “Oh he’s teething.

# [28] and you can see here THAT the order is first person and number of subject
# [29] And you'll notice that sometimes they appear twice in one word. Like in 'elbow' he's got it appearing word-initially before /k/ and he's also got it appearing between /s/ and /k/. So just make sure 0 you note every single one.

# [31] Barb probably had such a good time with you that she decided ZERO it might not be so bad
# [32] because he was convinced THAT like he would look like a total- you-know, more so than he already is

# [36] but in my head, knowing THAT i have to pay 8 percent more is really like, bothering me

# [38] but then the big difference is ZERO like she'll say "yes" to a question, period.

# [40] but we did find THAT like she was viewed as aggressive
# [41] but what I-- what I really liked about it and that I found different than most action movies was THAT when there was like explosions and like fight scenes I could-- like I could tell what was happening
# [42] But you have to understand THAT unlike Kim Il-sung and Jong-il, Kim Jong-un was like brought up in like North-Korea as it is today
# [43] cause it could be THAT we notice that there are no regularities

# [46] Everybody knows about the study going on, THAT I will be recording myself?
# [47] he [the judge] just- he just said 0 he didn't believe it, and acquitted him
# [48] he just said THAT you-know-
# [49] He just says what people want to hear, and like- For example when he was in Puerto-Rico he said THAT Puerto-Rico debt was going to be forgiven. He was like- you know like- "[trump voice] puerto rico. your debt? don't worry about it! the government? we're gonna forgive your debt! don't worry about it!" and then the stock market started crashing because like all these people- all these like parasites who buy puerto rico bonds or whatever to capitalize on the suffering of pe-- you-know, they all started freaking out and like calling the white house and then they walked it back.
# [50] He rams the car. Gets out. Goes to the front of the car and just like fires five shots at him. In the passenger seat. Because- he said, uh, he said THAT he feared for his life because the guy was reaching for a gun. Right? [int: "well you can't be chasing somebody and say you're afraid for your life"] So he fired six shots into him and killed him.
# [51] he said 0 "in my- in my 20 years of experience, I th- it would be very surprising if this "urban" you-know man didn't have a gun" [int: "wow"]
# [52] He said ZERO Frozen was not art, because it's propaganda designed for a political purpose, because it's the anti-Sleeping Beauty thing where like-
# [53] He said ZERO Frozen was propaganda. The movie Frozen.
# [54] he tells you THAT there's one rule that correctly predicts the allophone
# [55] He told me the other morning THAT he was going to live out of his truck!
# [56] He was like an officer in the states who said ZERO, like, he wanted to kill a certain like man- a black guy
# [57] His attorney said THAT "Smith refused commands to put up his hands and reached along the seat towards an area where a gun was found." So they're sayin like so he was reaching for a gun that's why i fired. "Testing found Stockley's DNA on the gun, but not Smith's."
# [58] However, if you find that the environment directly before and the environment directly after are still the same and this sound makes a difference, then you can be fairly sure THAT they're phonemes.
# [59] However, if you find that the environment directly before and the environment directly after are still the same and this sound makes a difference, then you can be fairly sure THAT they're phonemes.
# [60] I know but it's just so surreal THAT that guy that they were like you-know totally dumping on is like the president of the United-States now
# [61] I understand the "aiutami, no?" case, like what's going on there, so that you should see how obvious it is. But that's why it works with polite suggestions. "Ponte el traje nuevo" like 'why don't you put this outfit on?' because.. because it's so expected fro.. THAT.. you would do the same anyway
# [62] I was talking to someone from Western online and they were saying THAT he was- his office was like tucked into like a cubby hole, off the hallway from the main department

# [67] In English we have a rule THAT whenever voiceless stops like /p/, /t/, and /k/ occur at the beginning of a stressed syllable we aspirate.
# [68] In our minds, we store THAT there is this word.

# [74] It's a bummer THAT you guys aren't gonna be there.

I was gonna say he's married but you know 0 marriage doesn't force you to change in any meaningful way. N: Exactly. L: Unless you want it to. N: Have a child. L: Having a kid is probably more- more dramatic. N: Yeah. L: I figure when you get married you basically stay the same person. I don't know why marriage would change you. Like- N: Exactly. L: The only way that I can imagine someone meaning that marriage changed them would be that they're better to their spouse now than they were when they were unmarried but- N: Yeah. L: If marriage made you change the way you treat your partner, like why did it take marriage for you to treat them better?
# [91] L: What can I do? Me as one person, what can I do? N: Oh shit. Yeah. L: What would you do? N: Not buy shit. I'd move somewhere. L: And not buy s-- not buy shit?

L: I can't survive on my own, and I can't afford to even move out to somwehere. N: (laughs) Not even the woods? Damn. L: No! You need to buy property. N: Oh really... L: Or get punished by a government. N: (jokingly/mockingly) Oh, you're scared of the government! L: I mean you can go- you can go anarcho-communism but that's a whole other thing. N: Why?

# [97] Let's keep in mind THAT to be a minimal pair, we have to have the same number of sounds.

# [99] Let's make sure that we all remember THAT to be a minimal pair we have to have the same number of sounds.
# [100] Like the third one for example you can see 0 he's got S-underscore-K...
# [101] Make sure 0 you don't like rip this up into little pieces...

L: (laughs) It doesn't. How does it? How- how indeed. We're all wondering. We're all still waiting. N: It's just like normal tea, it doesn't do anything. L: It's a scam. N: It doesn't make you skinny. L: (jokingly) All tea makes you skinny. N: (laughs) L: Did you know? (ditzy voice) Did you know 0 tea is like so good for you? (laughs)
# [104] Note THAT uh- so [professor] has like specified some examples here for you.
# [105] Oh i th- they said there- they said there ZERO it's already dead.
# [106] Oh, and make sure 0 you're marking up your sheet.
# [107] On camera, said ZERO he wanted to kill him.
# [108] One of the big concerns is how can we make sure THAT we don't hire somebody that has you know a history of/a tendency for you know this kind of harassment.
# [109] One thing that linguists do quite a bit is THAT they work with languages that haven't been documented.
# [110] Or the reason we can't find a minimal pair is THAT /t/ and this flap are not separate phonemes in English.
# [111] People are saying ZERO it's like an anti-Trump protest, it's not, it's an anti police brutality protest
# [112] Remember 0 complimentary- eh uh it's actually comple- um complemetary distribution is Clark Kent and Superman, right.
# [113] Remember THAT there's even more.
# [114] Sabi mo kasi ZERO yung iHalo Krunch: twenty-nine forty; half tayo doon eh.
# [115] Say THAT it appears between- I don't know, this and S or something...
# [116] So because you know ZERO that's only S, and this is future, (lengthy explanation of how to solve morphology problem)
# [117] So for example, if you know THAT a certain part- (continued in next token)
# [118] so he said 0 one phoneme is 'blank', another is 'blank'
# [119] so he says 0 in Mokilese you have...
# [120] So imagine now THAT we're looking at just the- just the right side.
# [121] So just make sure 0 you email early if uh- you have questions.
# [122] So just remember ZERO 'to the left to the left' beyonce, to the left to the left is regressive
# [123] So make sure 0 you fill in your name on the top here and that you sign it.
# [124] So make sure 0 you indicate which side a morpheme is on.
# [125] So make sure you fill in your name on the top here and THAT you sign it.
# [126] So make sure ZERO you take advantage of that so you don't, you know, fall behind
# [127] So the Superman example- imagine THAT like in this case, you've got- take /e/ and then voiceless /e/.
# [128] So they took him into custody and someone didn't notice THAT he had- he had a gun, according to their story. And then they CUFFED him, and then he SHOT HIMSELF IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD. WHILE HE WAS CUFFED in the back seat of the police car.
# [129] So we can already tell 0 well /p/- /p/ and /b/ are separate phonemes in Sindhi.
# [130] So we know THAT there must be some kind of overlap between these two...
# [131] So we would say THAT the feature that distinguishes them is manner of articulation.
# [132] So what we're saying is 0 this counts for the three sounds that we're interested in.
# [133] So what you see here, whoops, no actually it should be here, sorry, is THAT English and Sindhi break up their sounds differently.
# [134] So you can see 0 the first one, he's got this (writes on board) and that means it appears at the beginning of a word before a /v/.
# [135] So you can tell THAT these are the same thing by the fact that...
# [136] So you know THAT like these are the two sounds right? S: Yeah. L: Okay, and then why did you think that- like what did you think happens? Did you think that it was these top ones changing into these ones or did you think it was these bottom ones changing into these ones? S: Uh I think it is top ones changing to bottom ones. L: Okay. And then why did you think that?
# [137] So you really have to make sure ZERO they're connected
# [138] So you'd say 0 it occurs before uvulars...
# [139] So your ta-- What you were supposed to do was figure out THAT the voiceless variant happens between voiceless consonants.
# [140] So, get started. In groups. (long pause) Make sure THAT you aren't all writing down the environments for [i] at the same time.
# [141] So, with that in mind we wanna decide how to group these sounds by phoneme. Meaning 0 we wanna be able to draw those trees for the phonemes.
# [142] Someone didn't sign- someone didn't sign it. [int: "Ohh, That sucks! Did a lot of people not sign it?"] Everyone signed it except for one person. I have a feeling they didn't understand, and I actually talked to [name], who is [redacted] and she said THAT I should um, try talk to them, like gently obviously.
# [143] Sometimes you forget 0 you’re recording yourself.
# [144] That is complementary distribution meaning 0 we have this one sound in our head, but how it comes out of our mouth depends on where it occurs in a word.
# [145] That makes a difference in meaning, ok, which means 0 they are separate sounds.
# [146] That means THAT /p/ actually has two realizations.
# [147] That means THAT /p/ is um-
# [148] That's another way 0 the data could look different, ok?
# [149] The cop literally says ZERO he wants to kill him, plants a gun on his dead body, and still gets off scot-free
# [150] The idea is that you have a phonemic representation of a sound in your head and 0 then the phonetic representation is what actually comes out of your mouth.
# [151] The idea is THAT you have a phonemic representation of a sound in your head and then the phonetic representation is what actually comes out of your mouth, ok?
# [152] the other thing is THAT I don't want to lose his confidence
# [153] the point is THAT they're all complicit in a fucked up system which is designed to you-know grind minorities into chunks and kill them. you know? it's insane to me. that like anyone can justify this.
# [154] The problem is THAT nobody succeeds.
# [155] the thing is ZERO there's so few students like . like our department is much smaller and also our department is not very . like .present
# [156] Then the rule would be 0 whenever /p/ occurs in the middle of a word, it will be aspirated.
# [157] There was an officer acquitted recently in uh the states who- he saw like two black guys exchanging money in a parking lot and decided THAT this was like a drug deal. And so he started- you know as the guy left...
# [158] There was DNA of the police officer on the SCREWS of the gun, meaning 0 he had disassembled it before
# [159] There's a rule in North American English THAT we flap when the sound occurs bet- when the /t/ occurs between two vowels.
# [160] They ACQUITTED him. EVEN THOUGH DNA testing showed THAT the police- there was no DNA from the suspect- the guy who was murdered- there was no DNE from him on the gun- and there was DNA from the police officer on the SCREWS of the gun.
# [161] They basically said ZERO he hid the gun-
# [162] They give us a different word, meaning 0 these sounds carry meaning.
# [163] they said THAT they didn't-
# [164] They said THAT you can take a 'savage' and learn- and teach em how to read and write, but he'll just be a savage who can read and write
# [165] This is going to count for participation marks so make sure 0 you actually write down the answers
# [166] Trudeau recently said THAT um, the reason we sold arms to Saudi Arabia was because we made a deal to them and we can't break- you-know, a deal
# [167] We agreed THAT if you had a partner, you'd do it with your partner.
# [168] We all know 0 we're talking about that yellow stuff that we use to cook and bake and whatever, right?
# [169] we can't pretend LIKE it's something of the past or something that's not like present in our field
# [170] We could say 0 in- in American English when it occurs between two vowels because this is not American, right, this is not American English, this is British English.
# [171] We have a couple of minimal pairs, meaning 0 they are separate phonemes.
# [172] We learned THAT in Sindhi- in Sindhi, for these three sounds unapirated /p/, aspirated /ph/, and /b/, our mental- the mental representation of speakers is this sound whoops is always realized as this.
# [173] Well, the grief counsellor told me THAT when you're coping ...
# [174] what I liked about it was THAT in all of--
# [175] What I think- what I think is really funny is THAT the democrats are all like super pragmatic you know like we can't all have universal health care, it's too unrealistic
# [176] What is this? Well, it's contrastive distribution, meaning 0 /p/ contrasts with /b/ and /p/ constrasts with /ph/.
# [177] What we do is 0 we call these near-minimal pairs, meaning the exact environment where our sound occurs are the same, but they are not identical [unintelligible].
# [178] What we do is we call these near-minimal pairs, meaning 0 the exact environment where our sound occurs are the same, but they are not identical [unintelligible].
# [179] What we're looking at is only THAT this environment is the same and that environment is the same.
# [180] What's nice about those textbook exercises that we're doing is 0 everything is made neat for you.
# [181] When sounds are in complementary distribution like that, that's a good indication THAT they might be um- they might be allophones of the same phoneme.
# [182] When the results of the case was announced, it says ZERO the National Guard was on standby in case a riot breaks out
# [183] Yeah he was handcuffed. And they- and they said THAT he- he- (stuttering) They basically said that he hid the gun- (continued in next token)
# [184] You don't know which one is maybe paired to which, you just know THAT- uh where is it- /i/ and /u/ might be you know Clark Kenting up against /e/ and /o/.
# [185] you guys know also THAT you can see like the answers
# [186] You have the disadvantage THAT your tutorial is on Mondays, right after the weekend.
# [187] You just say 0 it occurs 'elsewhere'.
# [188] You just write THAT it's not high.
# [189] You know THAT there's nothing else that can stand in a place where it doesn't stand, 'cause it stands everywhere.
# [190] You know ZERO there's a lot of resources available to your for this course...
# [191] You need more evidence to make the case THAT these are two phonemes.
# [192] you put the dash here, indicating THAT it attaches to the left side of a word
# [193] You said- you claim THAT it's a social science, when in fact it's a humanities program.

# [4] A: So syntactically a question should be either a yes/no question or a wh-question, but pragmatically, if something is pragmatically a question, it can be syntactically a declarative, as you said. \nInt: Yeah, yeah. But I don’t have any examples of that in my head. \nA: Hm. Let’s say you tell me a story, and.. I find out the last part: “..and finally he didn’t go”. “Yes”, you would say. I just said a declarative, with a fall and I expected THAT that would be the ending, so you say “yes”. This is what I can think of. \nInt: OK, yeah.
# [5] and I don't know THAT I would be comfortable in- insinuating that there was something analagous in that context right
# [6] And then she had this long pause to kind of intensity the- the moment. "Just tell me now" then she's like, "i heard THAT that you have great handwriting!"
# [7] Because i remember ZERO i had to purge three big boxes worth of clothes, because i could only bring two suitcases
# [8] D: I fi-- I replaced that one. L: I know 0 you did. I know you d-- I'm very proud of you.

# [14] I figured ZERO you know it would be nice to to kind of continue that
# [15] I forgot THAT [NAME] was there
# [16] I found THAT they sell like fake bologna, fake ham, and fake turkey
# [17] I just wanna walk around because I need to make sure THAT I get everybody's, ok?
# [18] I mean sometimes I'm like well, I should probably make sure that [redacted].
# [19] I remember ZERO we would just get together when we had to do like marking or or work on parts of our forum thesis and stuff like that

# [26] L: I know THAT you don't want it and that's okay 'cause now I rescind my offer 'cause now I like it and I'm gonna wear it.
# [27] L: I was gonna say 0 we had like- okay, so I think in America they have- what is it called, the Cartoon Network?
# [28] L: I'm surprised 0 he didn't stick his foot in it.
# [29] L: Not having second thoughts? N: Uh-uh. (jokingly) Unless you are. (laughs) Which I doubt. L: (laughs) You better think a-fuckin-gain. N: (laughs) L: You're right to doubt it. N: (laughs) No, just kidding. L: Did you ever like- I don't know. Am I always like transparent to you? N: Yeah. L: You always know that I want it? N: Yeah.

N: I can read you like a book. (laughs) L: (laughs) Oh my God, please!
# [30] L: Oh my God I look so rank. N: (laughs) L: 'Cause I was like rubbing my eyes and I forgot THAT I had mascara on. (laughs)
# [31] L: Um my mom and my dad would both leave really early for work but we didn't have school until like a few hours later. So they would always- we would have to get up really early and they would bring us- we would get like ready and stuff and then they would bring us to like someone's house, like a babysitter or something or like one of my brother's friends or something, who was older. N: Yeah. L: And then we would just have to like wait there for like two hours until we went to school. N: Yeah. L: So we would end up- or [childhood friend]'s house. N: Mm. L: And then we would end up like watching TV. And I remember 0 the shows that were on at that time that I ended up watching because they were on were like- not on YTV but on other channels- what was I just saying? I literally already forgot.
# [32] L: Where else would you like to go before you die? Not that I mean 0 you're going to die, but I mean like...

# [11] and I know ZERO they've been take-- like like there's more specific anthropology studies and things leaning that way

L: Having a kid is probably more- more dramatic. N: Yeah. L: I figure when you get married you basically stay the same person. I don't know why marriage would change you. Like- N: Exactly. L: The only way that I can imagine someone meaning that marriage changed them would be that they're better to their spouse now than they were when they were unmarried but- N: Yeah. L: If marriage made you change the way you treat your partner, like why did it take marriage for you to treat them better?

# [76] L: I mean, I watched a lot of Looney Tunes as a kid but like they would- by the time I got to be older they were like older. N: Yeah. L: And so like those were- I think 0 those were the only like old cartoons that I remember.
# [77] L: I really like old Spiderman. It's a fun show. It's cute. N: Yeah. L: I know you're a Batman guy though. N: Yeah, I watched Spiderman too on TV. L: Mm. I just think 0 it has the best intro.
# [78] L: I think 0 Barney was American.
# [79] L: I think 0 I didn't bring you green beans and rotkraut.
# [80] L: I think 0 I get what you mean if- if part of what you mean- not all of what you mean, but part of what you mean is like being able to speak and complain so freely about it makes you complacent. N: Oh yeah, they just like m-- just like nothing happens. Like they just move on with their lives. L: No action, yeah, it's just like a fad. Yeah. N: Like, "Oh, oh well, whatever." Yeah. It's like- pisses me off. L: Yeah. N: Like they don't like stand for it, they just say it for um- to make it seem like they're not a normie. L: Like they're- it's woketivism. It's like performative wokeness.
# [81] L: I think 0 we should maybe split them.
# [82] L: I think 0 you left a cup of water- like a tiny cup of water on the- on your dresser.
# [83] L: I thought 0 I left the light on.
# [84] L: I was gonna say we had like- okay, so I think 0 in America they have- what is it called, the Cartoon Network?
# [85] L: No, they get put in a box. N: Oh, I don't know that. L: And then slimed. I think 0 it was called 'Slimed'. N: Ah.
# [86] L: Okay, so there you go, there's your pictures. I mean it's different in different lighting too, so like- D: Yeah, the iPhone is- N: Yours has like- L: Nice like- D: Crisper image right? L: Hm? D: Can you see? N: Fancier options. L: Mine has like-yeah, mine like you can go into the camera and like customise all these options but for like the layman, I don't know what I'm doing with it so like it's kind of useleless. The iPhone has a better like dummy-proof- like just takes good pictures by \ndefault. Mine's probably like customisable but I don't know how to use it so it's basically whatever. D: Actually yours is pretty good though Lisa. L: I mean it's fine. N: It's Leica. L: It's a Leica lens, but- whatever that means, like whatever that's good for, you know? N: It's Like an actual camera, you know. L: Yeah, but like in practic-- like look at the pictures on the fridge. If you zoom in on them, they're really not that like clear. You see it's kind of like grainy almost? D: Well they're not bad. N: So is this. L: Well, that's true. I don't know. I don't know. R: Close enough. L: My- I think THAT iPhones also like- I don't know if they like colour grade...
# [87] L: Sometimes I drink tea and then I feel sleepier than I did before. I don't know what's going on with that. N: It's not- I don't know. L: I always wonder like- N: Green tea is different though. L: Well what's the deal with that? N: Green tea has more caffeine. L: It has more caffeine? N: Yeah, green tea. L: Oh, I thought 0 it had less. I swear it had less. I thought that was like why people drank it, 'cause it was like healthier 'cause it had less caffeine.
# [88] L: That is so cute! I thought 0 it was like some lame like superhero shit. I mean it is superhero shit but it's like- N: It's a cool show. L: Cool.
# [89] L: You've never been to Nashville? I thought 0 you had gone already.
# [90] Like I think 0 she had left.
# [91] like I think ZERO one of the things like sounding like a foodie is [unclear] like "oh the palate" and like "this evokes notes of blah"
# [92] like I think ZERO sometimes it's a narrative
# [93] N: We can get married elsewhere. L: Hm? N: Get married elsewhere. L: Where? N: In Vegas. L: (laughs) I think 0 it's not the act of getting married that needs to be hidden but…
# [94] N: What's this? L: Pierogis. M: Oh, nice. L: Some of them are- have sauerkraut inside and some of them are potato and cheese. I think 0 just one of them is sauerkraut.
# [95] No that's not- i don't think- i don't think ZERO we're going to- that's a mid high vowel
# [96] No, I think 0 we did have that at- during TA training.
# [97] No, i think ZERO you get full but then after an hour you're hungry again.
# [98] Not necessarily. i think ZERO for tensity- i don't know if he's going to go over this, but it's more of the constriction of not so much the root of the tongue, but the vocal fold constriction
# [99] Oh I think 0 somebody on Facebook was advocating for it or something.
# [100] R: Back in the day you didn't wear a facemask to play goal, right? And he took a ball right in the mouth and he had his w-- jaw wired shut for two months. N: Eugh. D: I know what that's like. I've had my jaw broken, I was wired for- L: (jokingly) I thought 0 you meant you'd taken balls to the mouth.
# [101] Sadly they don't- i think ZERO the department here is not very active
# [102] so I think . I think ZERO it'd be interesting.
# [103] So i think ZERO it was because of the other professor, who didn't really teach it that well, who ironically became my MA supervisor
# [104] so I think ZERO it's not quite .
# [105] so starting on page five I think ZERO I get into it
# [106] So then i thought ZERO this is probably why the lingusitics association is not active, because the people that are doing it are only the ones who are pusuing this for real, like in their third year or fourth year
# [107] So then, not to be stingy but then again, it's a grad school event, right? so i thought ZERO it would be funded.
# [108] So we- in the- in the essense of time, i won't make you do this. we'll just go through this really quickly, because stress, i think ZERO for all of you is rather intuitive.
# [109] So, i think ZERO in homework you encountered questions about, okay, given five- given these five segments, you-know, what is the similarity across all five segments, or
# [110] um but I think ZERO it just it it's more widely used in Toronto
# [111] Well I think ZERO you wouldn't even sign up for that class
# [112] Well, I thought 0 it was, but maybe not.
# [113] whereas like I think ZERO he goes into pretty lengthy answers
# [114] Yeah i think ZERO the humps would be a better strategy for you guys if you start studying it.
# [115] Yeah i think ZERO you can rinse- run it
# [116] yeah I was looking through it today and I think ZERO like there's a couple things I was thinking of looking at closer, but.
# [117] Yeah, so i think ZERO you're only responsible for the reds and the yellows

# [1] ... and I prepared for my tutorial, during that time, because I had an hour of- TA- (loud crashing noise) [int: "Sorry"] <smiling intonation> Can you be careful?! Jeez Louise. <normal intonation> Uh, so I did that. Um. And then I did the tutorial, and it wasn't as bad as I thought ZERO it was going to be. It was um, I thought I was gonna be more nervous but I wasn't really nervous.
# [2] [Barry] yeah? majority wins. we have a majority? yeah. i think ZERO that's okay, too.
# [3] [helping int fix window, who is holding it up so I can hammer it] think 0 it's- (laughs)
# [4] [int incomprehensible] I think 0 that's-
# [5] [int looking for information on her phone] I don't think ZERO it's gonna be on this page. It already says no.
# [6] [int: "you're good at that [trump impression]. You should go on uh SLN. Be the next"] (laughs) SNL? [int: "make your career." (laughs)] Yeah. I don't think I- I don't think there's a physical resemblance though.
# [7] A: I think 0 I... Mark should really not come to the department. \nInt: Why not?\nA: I MEAN, he’s just too active. I noticed THAT from last.. as soon as he accomplished or completed six months, he became so much more active. \nInt: Ah yeah, I was gonna say 0 he’s become more and more active.\nA: So I think 0 maybe this is not the right thing to do.
# [8] A: I think 0 I... Mark should really not come to the department. \nInt: Why not?\nA: I MEAN, he’s just too active. I noticed THAT from last.. as soon as he accomplished or completed six months, he became so much more active. \nInt: Ah yeah, I was gonna say 0 he’s become more and more active.\nA: So I think maybe this is not the right thing to do.
# [9] A: I think 0 yours is here already.
# [10] A: OK. I think 0 we have had enough English
# [11] A: So we came here and they didn’t let us in because of the stroller\nInt: Oh no\nA: Yeah, so I thought \nInt: Because it was busy in the evening?\nA: Yeah, yeah. So I thought maybe we’ll give it a try because it’s not the evening so maybe. And they let us in without any question they were ‘Yeah! Just come in!’\nInt: [...] in the evening because of the [...]
# [12] and 'cos I-- so I think ZERO I hurt my back because I was writing a paper last week and so I was like this for a long time
# [13] and I mean I guess- I guess Gastown is too in its own way but like but Vancouver I think has more of like works on the historic charm
# [14] and then I think ZERO most of the other things . are available . as ebooks or from York library
# [15] At first I thought 0 she was gonna seat us there.
# [16] But I don't think 0 she was there when I started.
# [17] Cause I think 0 exercise 2 will hopefully resolve all the questions that we still have.
# [18] Cause I think 0 that's like one of the biggest like- concerns that I have.
# [19] I can't believe that for six years I thought 0 [redacted] was [redacted] and now you're telling me her actual name is what?
# [20] I didn't even think ZERO there was nobody who I thought I could ask about getting getting it er embossed or whatever it is you would call that
# [21] I don't think 0 I can finish it.
# [22] I don't think 0 the police should have the monopoly on guns
# [23] I don't think ZERO we could do it- like do it the way we had to do it last year ...
# [24] I think 0 I have a more like gun-sympathetic take on it than you probably expected.
# [25] I think 0 if you're gonna disarm, you-know a country, you should start with the police
# [26] I think 0 it's because I'm in front of a computer all day.
# [27] I think 0 that's a good compromise
# [28] I think THAT if something came up here in Toronto that worked for me in terms of teaching
# [29] I think THAT this is good
# [30] I think ZERO Gastown has more of a like rustic kind of vibe to it than Yorkville does cause Yorkville is like upcscale a little bit
# [31] I think ZERO I ended up only coming here I didn't bring like any furniture any kitchenware stuff cause Dana had all that stuff
# [32] I think ZERO I had like three big like um like tote bins you know what I mean like the pastic ones
# [33] I think ZERO I had like three of those
# [34] I think ZERO I mentioned this in class but one of the things that I noticed the most was my vowel shifting
# [35] I THINK ZERO I might have that
# [36] I think ZERO I'm ambitious but not competitive
# [37] I think ZERO I'm easy going but also like there are some things that I principles that I don't always love to compromise on
# [38] I think ZERO men generally receive greater social rewards for helping than women do
# [39] I THINK ZERO my husband has tried to tell him that ...
# [40] I think ZERO that's a good idea.
# [41] I thought 0 [redacted] was in DC.
# [42] I thought 0 they cut off the first layer of whatever is on there.
# [43] I thought ZERO the combinatio of olives and figs was kind of weird but salty and sweet
# [44] I was thinking ZERO I might finally join a committee
# [45] I've been thinking THAT I should really get to get it together and um
# [46] It was um- I thought ZERO I was gonna be more nervous, but I wasn't really nervous.
# [47] it's like a Russian spa and tea room and I think ZERO you can talk in it
# [48] L: Celebrity crushes? D: Oh, George Clooney. L: You've always loved George Clooney. You've literally George- loved George Clooney for so many years, it's like you've loved George Clooney longer than you've loved me. N: (laughs) L: It's crazy. D: That's why I went out with [mother's boyfriend], 'cause I thought he looked like him. (all laugh) L: (to mother's boyfriend) I think 0 [my friend], when she met you, she said- she was like- she said afterward that you looked like George Clooney or something. (all laugh) D: See? See? L: 'Cause she said you had the like salt and pepper hair thing. D: Ah, see? Ah? George Clooney's got the salt and pepper. L: Yeah, and she- and she said it looked good on you.
# [49] L: I don't think 0 it's going to taste very good.
# [50] L: I think that Androids, like they actually- like when you buy- like when you set one up nowadays, I think 0 it might have like- that's like a thing it asks you for anyway, 'cause they know people might be coming from iPhone.
# [51] Oh i was thinking ZERO it's not like this
# [52] so I think ZERO in m-- like in my response I said I'm familiar with the variationist stuff and this is the stuff they pull on from anthropology and sociology
# [53] so I think ZERO what I'll do
# [54] So then I thought ZERO because in the [Project's name] project as well as the [Corupus' name] corpus, at the end of each interview, they have the ethnic orientation questionnaire,
# [55] Um, I think ZERO I like it better actually than our old place, because the walk is nicer
# [56] unle- I don't think ZERO I would apply to anything that's in like I also have to think like you know
# [57] well I had kind of thought ZERO I would go somewhere because one of my good friends...
# [58] Well i thought ZERO it was tourist-y
# [59] yeah but like I MEAN ever-- like everyone's different in that way too
# [60] yeah I think ZERO that's a good idea.
# [61] yeah I think ZERO the buildings are quite a bit newer there than in St. Jamestown and the management I think is more attentive
# [62] Yeah, and I first transcribed everything with "would". "And you would say the same, wouldn't you?" But then I erased that, before the presentation, and I wrote it differently, but I did use "would" in the first versions. But I thought 0 "Oh well.. would!" I don't want to go the modal way.. but then it's crucial.
# [63] Yeah, I think 0 transcribing this will be funny.
# [64] Yes, but I don't think 0 they understand the job market.
# [65] You call it the lemniscus? It's meniscus. [int: "sorry sorry"] You call it the lemniscus. [int: "Sorry I meant meniscus!"] That's right you DID mean meniscus. I thought ZERO YOU were the science lady!

# [1] [I think] THAT it is it's really descriptive
# [2] A: But that’s nobody’s fault, there are different types of babies, that’s what I heard, and I.. based on the stories of other moms, I think he’s a calm type of baby, because I sleep during the night.. OK in the first two months I didn’t do much but \nI: .. \nA: And plus it hurt.. but now that things have settled..
# [3] A: So he has his..\nInt: Oh you’re using my blanket!\nA: Yeah, he loves it! He likes it! And I always carry my blanket for breastfeeding with me. I think it’s cool! So thanks!
# [4] Actually I think 0 it's a natural part of [redacted].
# [5] and also i-- 'cos I think ZERO those three features are the really obvious difference between the two
# [6] And I think 0 a couple of people are not doing it at all cause they're just auditing.
# [7] and so I think ZERO I-- y-- well and based on other literature too I think ZERO you can make a pretty good case for foodie-ism being a . like a genuine kind of identity or way of being in the world
# [8] and some of those-- I think ZERO some of the other studies I cited too definitely talked about credibility
# [9] Because i think ZERO for me, this is also me trying to work my argumentation skills, because all to often whenever i'm with my friends, for example, and we have you-know very heated discussion about you-know fu- fur, or eating foie grois, or something
# [10] But I THINK ZERO by having the comparability
# [11] but it's so crowded up there in the summer I don't think ZERO I'd want to do it again
# [12] cause I THOUGHT ZERO you said ZERO
# [13] cos I think ZERO that's a pretty good one too
# [14] Engage, in that kind of platform. i think ZERO that's too public for me that you-know it's just going to so much time out of my hands to explain myself once i start liking something, "why did you like this? that's wrong!"
# [15] He used to not [shake people's hands] I think ZERO he... started doing it recently
# [16] I also think ZERO it's really interesting as a server-- I don't know if you've noticed this, like if people you know come in? or like friends come in to where you're working you're like [noise]
# [17] I don't think 0 being in the military's a regular job
# [18] I don't think anyone can know if he's crazy or not, but he's not um...
# [19] I don't think ZERO I've ever- I have ever experienced such an intense storm up there
# [20] I don't think ZERO the CIA wants him [Trump] dead
# [21] I don't think ZERO you should let yourself just like ignore- you-know, what's-
# [22] I just think ZERO she has a lot of problems.
# [23] I mean I do think 0 some people are more prone to it than others.
# [24] I really think ZERO you guys should exploit the fact that we so many days for office hours
# [25] I think 0 exercise 2 will really help with this.
# [26] I think 0 he really liked the camera that you got him.
# [27] I think 0 I owe you guys homework now.
# [28] I think 0 it hurts
# [29] I think 0 it sounds like a dream job.
# [30] I think 0 technically we're supposed to do the same.
# [31] I think 0 that went really well.
# [32] I think 0 there was just so much watching each other.
# [33] I think 0 there's a lot of brilliant people that haven't found good work.
# [34] I think 0 we come first, the recording comes second.
# [35] I think 0 we should go. Because he's [??]
# [36] I think also THAT there's something like fundamentally comforting for um for a lot of people
# [37] I think he's less crazy than Trump is for sure.
# [38] I think I- think 0 I can handle it
# [39] I think THAT part of it is because of the like you know the the affective fundamentally affective nature of these topics for these speakers right
# [40] I think ZERO he's a rational actor but he's also not that smart, I-don't-think, because he killed his brother and-
# [41] I think ZERO I'm really indecisive
# [42] I think ZERO in the past f- ten years or so, this interest with speech pathology really, like, went up
# [43] I think ZERO it's . it's good that now we're actually going to have these discussions 'cos we can't pretend LIKE it's something of the past or something that's not like present in our field
# [44] I think ZERO it's 'cos I started with expectations that were like zero
# [45] I think ZERO jury duty would be really cool
# [46] I think ZERO that's a really really good point though
# [47] I think ZERO the information is still up on my account.
# [48] I think ZERO w-- and like particularly female professors
# [49] I THINK ZERO we should just do one per week
# [50] I THINK ZERO we stopped for lunch at Port Carling this time
# [51] I THINK ZERO you'd have to uhm like right now go and look
# [52] I thought 0 it hurt a little bit.
# [53] I thought 0 they were painful.
# [54] I was thinking ZERO if at one o'clock yesterday, I'm like, "am I going to start the stats?"
# [55] I was THINKING ZERO it must be because it's right on Carlaw or Logan or I don't know
# [56] If you were a refugee from Pinochet's Chile back when he was in charge, you-know I don't- I don't think 0 they're gonna- you-know, they're not gonna make like a you-know make a case for you
# [57] Int: So you think THAT... we should be able to classify or associate \nA: Well maybe not as a one-to-one relation, \nInt: Yeah, but like this tends to occur with \nA: At least in terms of tendencies, I think 0 it should be possible. At least what they find is 0, tendentially it is possible to say things, right?\nInt: I guess that’s what they are saying about high tone.
# [58] L: 'Cause I complain about capitalism. N: Yup. L: And I don't think 0 that's wrong. I think that it's like- N: Yeah, I mean like it's- it's like bad and exploiting- L: Yeah. I mean, it's shitty.
# [59] L: I think THAT Androids, like they actually- like when you buy- like when you set one up nowadays, I think it might have like- that's like a thing it asks you for anyway, 'cause they know people might be coming from iPhone.
# [60] L: I wanna watch Bake Off. N: Is it on? L: Uh I think 0 I can get it… I think I can get the most recent one.

L: And like this man- like I don't know, like he was walking across the street and like I'm looking at him and like I thought 0 he was like bracing against the wind or something but like I look at him- like I'm like watching him 'cause I'm like at a red light. N: Yeah. L: And man is like literally like bent at like a ninety degree angle.
# [63] L: No raspberries this year either. D: Oh I had some this year, yup. I think I just kept them for myself. (laughs) L: (jokingly dramatic) Are you fucking kidding me? Unbelievable. I thought 0 I was your favourite son and I don't even get any fruit.
# [64] L: Sometimes I drink tea and then I feel sleepier than I did before. I don't know what's going on with that. N: It's not- I don't know. L: I always wonder like- N: Green tea is different though. L: Well what's the deal with that? N: Green tea has more caffeine. L: It has more caffeine? N: Yeah, green tea. L: Oh, I thought it had less. I swear it had less. I thought 0 that was like why people drank it, 'cause it was like healthier 'cause it had less caffeine.
# [65] Like I think 0 [redacted] bought it.
# [66] Like I think 0 it's super ridiculous if you have like uh- if you name your own kid after yourself.
# [67] my brother is building this mansion in North Bay so I THINK ZERO my brother's idea is that my father will move in with him
# [68] N: I love how there were old people at the show. L: I love when there's like old people like watching a show and they like- they just sit there with their arms crossed. (laughs) It's so funny to me. N: Yeah. They don't get it. L: I think 0 they like get it, they're just like... over it.
# [69] N: What would someone do to like stop it like fully? L: Well that's the whole point, is that no one person can. N: What if we worked together? L: That's the whole thing- N: But people don't like teamwork. L: That might be true. N: They always think about themselves. L: Mm. Now that it's- N: "Too much work!"L: Now that it's popular to like popular to complain about capitalism or like- N: Yeah, it's like a popular thing rather- like , "Oh shit-" L: That's why it's pissing you off, eh? N: Yeah. Buys tonnes of shit from- Sephora, I guess...

# [72] no I think ZERO he still is
# [73] no I think ZERO he still is
# [74] no, I think ZERO they're pretty my parents are surprisingly . like because they're very pragmatic people ? but for me when I was kinda going through like oh maybe I'll drop out of my PhD I don't know [noise] they were like ehh you have this opportunity just do it.
# [75] No, no, next time when we learn syllables, i think ZERO you're going to start putting dots
# [76] Oh, I think 0 we already booked the flights.
# [77] Okay, well I don't think ZERO we need to get a huge order
# [78] Since it’s his birthday I thought 0 I’d take the ten o’clock bus.
# [79] so I think THAT their their use of creak here is is almost like a signaling right
